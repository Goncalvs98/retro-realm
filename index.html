                <p>
                    Os jogos retro são aqueles que foram lançados em sistemas de videogame 
                    mais antigos, como o Atari, Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Sega 
                    Genesis, Super Nintendo (SNES), entre outros. Eles são caracterizados 
                    por gráficos pixelizados, sons sintetizados e mecânicas de jogo simples, 
                    mas viciantes.
